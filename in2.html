            Don't swear on your mom
            That it's the first drink that you've had in, like, a month
            No, don't say it was just an isolated incident that happened once
            There's no need to pretend
            I've never seen an ugly truth that I can't bend
            To something that looks better, I'm stupid, but I'm clever
            Yeah, I can make a shit show look a whole lot like forever and ever
            You don't have to lie to girls

            If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
            Like you, they'll just lie to themselves
            You don't have to lie to girls
            If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
            Don't I know it better than anyone else?
            All of your best excuses
            No, they don't stand a chance
            Against all the chances I give you
            Isn't ideal, but damn

            You don't even have to try, turn you into a good guy
            You don't have to lift a finger
            It's lucky for you I'm just like
            My mother (and my sisters)
            All my (all my friends)
            The girl outside the strip club getting her tarot cards read
            We love to read the cold, hard facts
            And swear they're incorrect
            We love to mistake butterflies for cardiac arrest
            You don't have to lie to girls

            <mark style="background-color:pink">they like you, they 'll just lie to themselves</mark>
            Like you, they'll just lie to themselves
            You don't have to lie to girls (don't have)
            If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
            Don't I know it better than anyone else?

            Girls will cry, and girls will lie
            And girls will do it 'til they die
            And for you, they'll cry
            And girls will lie
            And do it 'til the day they die (for you)
            Girls will cry, and girls will lie (ooh, ooh)
            And girls will lose their goddamn minds (ooh, oh)
            For you, they'll cry
            And girls will lie
            And do it 'til the day they die
            For you
